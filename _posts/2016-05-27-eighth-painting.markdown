<span class="dropcap">W</span>rapped up my eighth painting this week, huzzah! This one, which I affectionately dubbed "scrubflats", is a piece inspired by Magic: the Gathering's Scrublands and Marsh Flats cards.

This piece took a while to complete as I really wanted to push myself in a few areas. Specifically, I wanted a more dramatic sky, sense of scale and depth, and to include architecture (even if it's just ruins). I learned a lot and am pretty happy with the final result, which is surprising considering that I detested it at some points. I can't accurately estimate how much time went into this one, but the hours certainly piled up over the last couple of months. 

Now that this one is finished I'll be starting number nine soon, with 100% more water!
