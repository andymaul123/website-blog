<span class="dropcap">A</span> gust of damp air brushed against her cheek. She stirred, slowly opening her eyes to gaze out across the dunes, and gasped. The horizon was a roiling mass of amethyst clouds, quietly smothering the sun. A few stray blades of light pierced through, scattering across the broken landscape and glinting on the edges of the menhirs. Above the vista, blurred hues of orange and purple surrendered to velvet black. Hundreds of thousands of stars studded the night, a twinkling shroud to cover her world. She didn’t bother to wipe away the tears this time, letting them cascade freely down her cheeks. Which were greater, she wondered? The stars above or the grains of sand beneath? She laughed, allowing herself a precious moment of absurdity. Softly, the tears fell from where they pooled on her chin to the dust below. She blinked away more. A presence behind her, and the smile faded. It was the sorcerer. Her captor.

“Storm’s coming.”

Painting #11 started out as a desire to bring to life a scene conjured up in a writing session one fine, summer day. My partner and I have a tradition of going to a local bookstore on Sundays, getting a cup of coffee or beer (they have a bar inside - yeah, it's pretty sweet), and doing some kind of work. Often I find myself ruminating over fantastical worlds and concepts, which frankly, amounts to glorified daydreaming. Lately I've been curating these ideas, hoarding them up like little gems and slowly piecing together a cohesive world; one day I hope to write some books based on the foundations I'm building today. It was one of these little fragments that I chose to base this painting on.

I worked on my eleventh painting, which is unofficially dubbed "Storm's Coming", for most of the summer. My work schedule during the blistering months doesn't lend itself to staying up late and painting, and thus I struggled with completing it. In the end, though, I'm pretty happy with the outcome. I had a _lot_ of fun working on the mass of clouds, and totally underestimated the skill required to paint galaxies. For my next pieces and the immediate future I'm not going to be focusing on original pieces and instead practicing skills using reference photos. Scouring the internet for amazing imagery is a fun little adventure in itself, and I'm excited to not have to agonize over compositions for a little while. Practice makes perfect, and I feel like I need to get in some iterations.
