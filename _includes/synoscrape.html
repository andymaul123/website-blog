		SynoScrape is a Google Chrome extension I wrote as a learning project. I wanted to create a thesaurus-like application that provided me with synonyms to words I selected on the web. SynoScrape works by storing and sanitizing the user's highlighted text down to a single word. Then it uses the Yahoo Query Language to set up a cross-domain ajax request to Thesaurus.com. From there it extracts up to ten synonyms and serves them back through a browser alert box. For more information click the link above which will take you to the Github page.</p>
