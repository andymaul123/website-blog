		Adventure.js is a personal project I started with two goals: practice working with javascript objects/inheritance and jQuery in general. What better environment to practice that than a game? Games have a lot of overhead, though, so I opted to create a simple text-adventure. It's browser-based, contains a handful of "rooms" to explore, and even a monster to fight!
