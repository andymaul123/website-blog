	Dice Roller started out as practice in writing JavaScript. I decided to remake the very first program I ever wrote: a dice-rolling simulation in visual basic. After I scripted the functionality for a cube I decided to push it as far as I could and recreate all six of the original D&D dice. Currently fully-functional in Chrome, Safari, and Opera.</p>
