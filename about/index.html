        <p>Thanks for visiting. If you're looking for my resume, you've found the right place! If you're interested in knowing a little more about me, well, I can help out with that too.</p>

        <p>My background is in video games, a craft that marries storytelling, art, programming, and more. Though I've since dedicated myself to web development, I carry that background with me and it influences the way I approach life. My free time is spent painting landscapes, reading, and listening to Synthwave. I like tattoos, cooking, motorcycles, and play Magic the Gathering. I hope to one day write a novel, travel the world, and speak several languages (in no particular order).</p>
