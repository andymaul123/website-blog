        <p>Thanks for taking a look around. If you're seeking out my resume, you've found the right place - it's just below. If you're interested in knowing a little more about me, well, I can help out with that too. <br/><br/>My background is in video games, a craft that marries storytelling, art, programming, and much more. Though I've since dedicated myself to web development, I carry that background with me and it influences the way I approach life. My free time is spent painting landscapes, reading, and listening to music (Synthwave is my favorite genre). I like tattoos, motorcycles, and play Magic the Gathering. Coffee is best served black, but I respect your right to dilute it. I casually participate in NaNoWriMo and Inktober, having finished the former only once.
