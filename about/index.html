        <p>Thanks for visiting. If you're looking for my resume, you've found the right place! If you're interested in knowing a little more about me, well, I can help out with that too.</p>

        <p>My background is in video games, a craft that marries storytelling, art, programming, and more. Though I've since dedicated myself to web development, I carry that background with me and it influences the way I approach life. My dev experience is mainly front-end, but I am slowly investing my time into full-stack tech. Outside of work you can find me engaged in one of my (too) many hobbies; check the Blog for more details on those.</p>
